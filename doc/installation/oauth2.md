Enable OAuth2 Authentication
============================

If you want OAuth2 authentication:

* go to localhost:8000/admin. Log in with the superuser credentials

* add a new OAuth2 client with the desired data.

Now you can authenticate yourself with the given client id and secret. During development phase it's recommended to turn OAuth off.
